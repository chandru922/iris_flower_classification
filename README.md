# iris_flower_classification
This project involves the classification of iris flowers into different species based on their features. It leverages machine learning techniques to build a model capable of accurately categorizing iris flowers.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. By using features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, the model aims to make accurate predictions about the species of iris flowers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `data` directory and is named `iris_dataset.csv`. It includes measurements of iris flowers along with their corresponding species labels. Feel free to use your own dataset if you have one.
